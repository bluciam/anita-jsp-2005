This repository contains the source jsp and java files for the 
Anita Conti Mapping Server using Tomcat and the intensional infrastructure
for web programming called intense.

The ACMS requires other software, some publically available, some was
never released (that software was not written by me!).

The ACMS was left in the experimental, almost prototype state, and
served as proof of concept. It was used to find weakness in the engine
and flaws that required more careful study and development. That become
another project.

If you ever have any questions about the contents in this repository, 
I'll be happy to answer them.
